# DFIT
Closure stress and DFIT analysis
# This script can be used to find the following in DFIT test:
1- Fracture half length
2- Estimated closure time
3- Time to establish analyzable reservoir transient (empirical apprix.)
4- time to reach pseudo radial flow
5- Closure Stress/pressure (min principal stress) using G-function plot (User needs to find the pressure from the plot, so familiarity with the analysis is required)
